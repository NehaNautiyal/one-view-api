If it takes you half an hour to cut up your veggies or cut up you meat or whatever, that will still take a half an hour! But we love our Instant Pot! In my opinion the food just tastes better. Chicken might be a bit on the rubbery side (that's over stating it) but the flavors that come out are amazing. An unexpected benefit.As to the WiFi piece and the app: I have mixed feelings. First of all, it works. It's great to just have the Instant Pot sending me messages like when it changes modes or if there's a problem or how much time is left. That part works great and I love it for that alone. Everything else we control from the front panel of the device so I don't really care about how much control I have of the Instant Pot from my phone. You're trying to save time. Digging out your phone, opening the app, finding the right part of the app to set this up uses up more time. What's the point?!I as well as many others recommend this version of the Instant Pot.",

Granted, you can't do two things at once so a little planning is required. Most of the time listed for prep is longer, but I am slow. I liked it so well, gave one our daughter. She likes being able to get the meal on the table in just a short time. There are lots of recipes out there on the internet so buying a cookbook is only needed if you really want the book. You can find and some conversion instructions there as well. The timer let's you set up a time delay for the slow  cooker part. You can go from frozen to cooked as well.
